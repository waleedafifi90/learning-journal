# How computer actually works

Computers are changing the world, so whats make a computer a computer? How information is represented using electricity? How computers using the circuit to do simple math to simulated a whole entire virtual world.

The main 4 parts of a computer "CPU, Input, Memory, Output"


__Content table__

1. Input
2. Storage
3. Output
4. Binary System
5. Logical gates
6. CPU and Memory
7. Hardware and Software

Can a machine help with thinking work, like solving equations or tracking stars in the space?
- Take information from input
- Store information
- process it
- Output result

## Input
Like keyboard, mouse, mic, camera, touch screen, gamepad, all of this whats make computer so stuff.

## Storage
Input store information into memory then send it to the processor using a series of algorithms and send it back to store it into memory again then send it to output.

## Output
Output can any information like text, photos, videos, game, VR, or output of one computer can be another computer input

## Binary system
Computer understand only 0,1 and this is the smallest piece of information a computer can store and its called a __BIT__

With more _BIT_ you can represent more complex Information

### This Binary number
- Decimal has 10 digits from 0-9
- Binary have only 2 digits 0,1

So when you need to insert number 9 in binary it will be __1001__

| G          | 7            | 00111 |

## Logical gates

- Not
- And
- Or
- Nor
- Nand
- Xor

#### Not
A simple circuit takes an electronic signal and flips it so if the signal is 1 it flip it to 0

#### And
The circuit will only give you a 1 if both circuit are 1

## Cpu and Memory
The CPU calculates how to display _Pixel_ by Pixel, its run instructions, and store the results into the memory then this Pixel sent to the screen in Binary to shows.

## Hardware and Software

### Hardware

1. Chips
2. Memory
3. CPU
4. Circuit
5. Plugs
6. Speakers

## Software

1. Apps
2. Games
3. Website
4. Maps
